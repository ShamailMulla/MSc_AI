We were in the middle of a house,
Not far from a range of moving rails.
Railings were made in all sorts of colours,
And talked of in a funny way,--like the talk of a satanic satanic satan.

True, there was that old satanic satanic satan who spoke these words;
But I could see that he was losing his cool.

His face was not of the pleasant face you see in the literature,
And I could see that he was having a spirit of some one else awful
And anxious to be heard;--my own satanic mother.

Not all were as gloomy as I was,
And some were as happy as some.

But the happiest were the the the most,
For those who had the least to fear,
Are the ones who have the most to fear.

The mother I know, who had a strong belief in the unknown,
And who was sadly annoyed when I told her that I expected
To Know the secrets of the Man Who Lived within the Door,
Did not receive a penny on her death row,--I am not ridiculous!
But that ruined that belief, and she was never more afraid.
